# portfolio2
I started my assignment by adding a navbar and footer from bootstrap. I had to edit the navbar so that it only had four sections. Those sections were my name, and 3 links. Those 3 links were about, portfolio, and contact.
My portfolio and contact page were made from scratch using bootstrap. For my portfolio page, I edited a grid layout from bootstrap and added 2 more sections. My contact page was made from a form controls page in bootstrap
. All 3 pages are responsive.
